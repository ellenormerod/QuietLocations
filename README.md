# QuietLocations

A react native app for users to find and review bars and restaurants based on their noise level.

This app includes both this repo (the frontend) and the QLServer repo (backend) to work so make sure to check that one out.  

To run this repo clone it to your local machine and cd into it and run it in xcode.
